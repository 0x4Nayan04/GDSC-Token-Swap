## Token-Swap
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Due to some technical issues (possibly due to a 1inch API issue), this code is currently not working. Additionally, I don't have real MATIC to perform testing. I am working on fixing these issues. üöß

## Description

Token-Swap is a Next.js project that enables users to swap Matic tokens for either USDC or WETH tokens. It integrates with the 1inch API to fetch real-time conversion rates, allowing users to see the swap conversion price before executing the transaction. This project is built with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, providing a seamless user experience for cryptocurrency enthusiasts looking to exchange their assets.




## Features

- **Token Swapping**: Swap Matic tokens for USDC or WETH tokens directly from your wallet.
- **Real-time Conversion Rates**: Fetch and display the current conversion rates for your swap, ensuring you get the best possible deal.
- **User Authentication**: Securely sign in and manage your transactions with NextAuth integration.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and responsive UI that looks great on all devices.
